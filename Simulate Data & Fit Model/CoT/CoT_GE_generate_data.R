  # SIMULATION PROGRAM FOR EVOLVING AND CREATING EXTENDED PEDIGREE & TWIN DATA                      #
  # by Matthew C Keller, updated April 3, 2012                                                     #

  #This is newest script from March 20, 2024
  
  
  #TO RUN: 1) Create two folder: script.directory (where the scripts will be placed) and output.directory (where the GE output will go)
  #        2) Open the GeneEvolve.zip file in your "script.directory" - all scripts must remain in that directory.
  #        3) Make changes to the parameters below (#1 of this script) by placing your desired inputs to the *right* of the arrows (<- x  # i.e., user replaces "x").
  #        4) Advanced users might consider changing parameters under section 1.5
  #        5) Never remove any hash marks (#). Never change anything outside of sections 1 & 1.5
  #        6) Run entire script, either in BATCH mode (e.g., R CMD BATCH GeneEvolve69.R on UNIX run line) or by highlighting the entire script and running it in an R session.
  #        7) At end, you will have 5 data files in your output.directory (extended families of different twin types) plus a PDF summary of each GeneEvolve run and several matrices

  start.pop.size <- 100000       # breeding population size at start of simulation; should be > 500

  # for constant 5% growth: rep(1.05,number.generations)               
  
  #MODEL DETAILS:
  thresholds <- FALSE      # EITHER a vector of thresholds corresponding to location on standard normal OR "FALSE", meaning continuous
  am.model <- rep(1,14)    #vector of length 14 representing paths from parental P to mating phenotype
  # In order: A, AA, D, F, S, U, MZ, TW, SEX, AGE, A.by.SEX, A.by.AGE, A.by.S, A.by.U). Common options include:
  # rep(1,14) is the standard primary phenotypic AM
  # c(0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0) is social homogamy
  # c(0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) is pure cultural homogamy
  vt.model <- rep(1,14)      #vector of length 14 representing paths from parental P to parenting phenotype
  # In order: A, AA, D, F, S, U, MZ, TW, SEX, AGE, A.by.SEX, A.by.AGE, A.by.S, A.by.U). Common options include:
  # rep(1,14) is the standard parental phenotype to offspring F
  # c(0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0) is environmental influences of parental phenotype to offspring F
  # c(0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) is pure cultural transmission - parental F to offspring F - NOTE: this typically leads to unstable, non-equilibrium values of VF (either increasing to infinity or decreasing to 0)
  
  #DATASET PARAMETERS
  percent.mz <- .5              # % of twins who are MZ (in pedigree creation)
  range.dataset.age <- c(1,150)  # The pedigree datasets includes twins plus twin offspring,sibs, 
  # spouses, and parents. This is the range of ages in that dataset
  range.twin.age <- c(48,55)     # Range of twin ages in final dataset at each timepoint. Is a 
  # VECTOR twice as long as # of (repeated) measurements
  # Ex. 1, for data of adult twins of all ages measured once: <- c(18,100)
  # Ex. 2, for data of twins measured at exactly 14: <- c(14,14) 
  # Ex. 3, for data of twins measured at 14-18 and again (i.e., REPEATED MEASURES) at 
  #        18-25: <- c(14,18,18,25) 
  
  
  #VARIANCES: These are variance terms of 1st gen (they may change thereafter). 
  # It is nice, but unnecessary, for them to sum to 1
  
  #Genetic Factors:
  A  <- .2       # var acct for by A (additive genetic variance)
  AA <- .0       # var acct for by AxA (additive-by-additive) epistasis. 
  D  <- .2      # var acct for by D (dominance genetic variance)
  
  #Environmental Factors:
  U <- .2        # var acct for by U (unique variance). 
  # Note: in non-twins, E (eg, the E from ACE models)=U+MZ+T
  MZ <- .0       # var acct for by special MZ twin env (this goes into E for non-mz individuals)
  TW <- 0       # var acct for by special twin env (this goes into E for non-twin individuals)
  S <- .2       # var acct for by S (sibling environment). 
  
  #Vertical Transmission Variance & Path Coefficients
  F <- .2       # this is the var acct for by F in the first generation; it will change thereafter as a function of AM. 
  mat2pat <- 1   # "maternal relative to the paternal VT effect" - this is how much greater the maternal path coefficient from maternal phenotype to F (mvt) is than the paternal path coefficient to F (pvt). E.g., if set to 2, the maternal path coefficient is twice the paternal one (mvt=2pvt). Set to 1 for maternal effect = paternal effect (mvt=pvt).
  #Note that VF without AM is expected = tau^2(mvt^2 + pvt^2), where tau^2 is the variance of the parenting phenotype. GeneEvolve internally figures out what the actual maternal and paternal path coefficients need to be (given F, mat2pat, and vt.model) to give V(F)=F for the first generation, and in such a way that V(F) is stable over time absent AM (with AM, V(F) tends to increase).
  #If users want to input their own specific values of mvt and pvt rather than have GeneEvolve do this for them, simply change mvt and pvt in the final lines under "ADVANCED USER INPUT PARAMETERS" then "OPTIONAL VT INPUT" below. If this is done, the value of F will be VF in the parents of gen0 and mat2pat above will be ignored.
  
  
  #Covariates & Moderators
  AGE <- .0      # var acct for by age; This term can be negative;

  R.Alevel.Aslope.U <- .0   #corr bw intercept & slope. Should be b/w -1 & 1. 
  # Note on R.Alevel.Aslope.X: these are the corr's b/w the intercepts and slopes of A;
  # e.g., do people with the highest A values also have the highest changes in A across X?
  # if this is 1 (-1), A.by.X becomes the scalar interaction coefficient 
  # - i.e., the PURCEL model where h2 increases (decreases) as X increases
  # if this is 0, A.by.X becomes nonscalar 
  # - i.e., h2 remains ~ constant but diff genes turn on at diff values of X
  # WARNING: for scalar interactions, including only interaction var with no main effect var of A
  # will not produce what is desired!

  #The below should generally NOT be changed (it should be FALSE). mu is just a trick to be able to provide proper expectations of variances and covariances, and so will decrease naturally over time if the r(sps) is constant and VY is increasing. Forcing mu to be constant isn't something we want to try to simulate (and if you do, it will often create impossible scenarios, such as r(sps) > 1 whenever VY*mu>1)
  mu.constant <- FALSE       #the default in GeneEvolve is for the spousal CORRELATION (see "latent.AM" below) to stay constant over generations. However, if you want to make mu constant, change this to "TRUE". If you do this, GeneEvolve will interpret the values of "latent.AM" below to be the mu's rather than the correlations. This is generally NOT recommended.
